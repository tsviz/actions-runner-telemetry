⚠️ RECOMMENDATION: Upgrade to Larger Runner
├─ CPU peaked at 100.0% (avg: 60.4%)
├─ Memory peaked at 95.6% (avg: 75.4%)
├─ Suggested: Linux 4-core (4x faster, same cost)

```

All reports include:
- **Live interactive charts** (CPU/Memory trends, pie charts)
- **Process list** showing what's running
- **Cost analysis** with upgrade recommendations
- **Per-step breakdown** if you add step markers

## Quick Start

Add one step to any workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Monitor Runner
        uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
      
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
```

Done. The report appears in your workflow summary when the job finishes.

## Real-World Usage

**"Why is my build slow?"**  
→ Check the Top Processes section. See if something's hogging CPU.

**"Should I pay for a bigger runner?"**  
→ Look at the cost analysis. It shows you the actual math—not guesses.

**"Why do I keep hitting timeouts?"**  
→ Check peak memory usage. If it's near 90%, you probably need more RAM.

**"Which build step is the bottleneck?"**  
→ Use per-step tracking to see CPU/memory per step.

## Installation

### Minimal (One-liner)

```yaml
- uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
```

Runs in background and automatically generates the report at job completion.
No extra `mode: stop` step is required. The action includes a post step that
always runs at the end of the job (even on failures) to stop collection and write
the summary/dashboard.

### Full Control

```yaml
- name: Start monitoring
  uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1

# ... your build steps ...

- name: Generate report
  if: always()  # Runs even if steps fail
  uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
  with:
    mode: stop
```

### With Per-Step Tracking

Want to know which step uses the most resources?

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  
  - name: Start
    uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1

  - name: Mark - Install
    uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
    with:
      mode: step
      step-name: "Install Dependencies"
  
  - name: Install
    run: npm ci
  
  - name: Mark - Build  
    uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
    with:
      mode: step
      step-name: "Build"
  
  - name: Build
    run: npm run build
  
  - name: Mark - Test
    uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
    with:
      mode: step
      step-name: "Test"
  
  - name: Test
    run: npm test
  
  - name: Stop
    if: always()
    uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
    with:
      mode: stop
```

Now your report includes a per-step breakdown showing which step used the most CPU/memory.

## Options

| Option | Default | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Set to `false` to disable without removing the action |
| `mode` | `start` | `start`, `stop`, `step`, or `snapshot` |
| `interval` | `2` | Sample every N seconds |
| `step-name` | — | Name of the step (used with `mode: step`) |

### Modes Explained

- **`start`** - Begin monitoring (default)
- **`stop`** - Stop and generate the report
- **`step`** - Mark a step boundary 
- **`snapshot`** - Quick 10-second capture

## What Gets Measured

The report includes:

- **CPU Usage** - Current, peak, and average per-core utilization
- **Memory** - Current, peak, and average RAM usage
- **Load Average** - System load over 1/5/15 minutes
- **Disk I/O** - Read/write rates and total throughput
- **Network I/O** - RX/TX rates  
- **Processes** - Top 5 by CPU and memory, with descriptions
- **I/O Wait** - If the disk is bottlenecking
- **Swap Usage** - If you're running out of RAM
- **CPU Steal** - If the runner is oversubscribed

## Disable When Needed

```yaml
env:
  TELEMETRY_ON: false

- name: Monitor
  uses: tsviz/actions-runner-telemetry@v1
  with:
    enabled: ${{ env.TELEMETRY_ON }}
```

## Output Files

The action creates these files (optional to upload):

| File | What it contains |
|------|-----------------|
| `telemetry-report.html` | Interactive dashboard artifact |
| `telemetry-raw.json` | All raw metrics data |
| `telemetry-samples.csv` | Time-series data for analysis |
| `telemetry-summary.json` | Flattened summary |

To keep them:

```yaml
- name: Upload report
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: runner-telemetry
    path: |
      telemetry-report.html
      telemetry-raw.json
      telemetry-samples.csv
```

## Local Testing

```bash
docker build -t runner-telemetry-action .

docker run --rm \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/github/workspace" \
  -e GITHUB_WORKSPACE="/github/workspace" \
  -e GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY="/github/workspace/summary.md" \

  runner-telemetry-action

cat output/telemetry-report.md
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does this slow down my workflow?**  
A: No. Sampling happens every 2 seconds in the background. Overhead is <1% CPU.

**Q: Is this only for Linux runners?**  
A: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows runners. Metrics vary slightly by OS.

**Q: Can I use this on a self-hosted runner?**  
A: Yes. Works anywhere Docker runs.

**Q: Why would I upgrade to a bigger runner?**  
A: If your job uses >85% CPU/memory consistently, you'll hit timeouts. A bigger runner costs more per minute but jobs finish faster—and might be cheaper overall when you count developer time.

**Q: Where's the dashboard?**  
A: In your workflow summary tab (the one that shows job status). GitHub natively renders Markdown with charts.
